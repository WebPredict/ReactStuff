## Redux-friendly MultiSelect component, in ES6

MultiSelectPicker is a simple, multi-select control with search filtering, storing all its state in the Redux store.
props.availableOptions are the left side; props.pickedOptions are the right side.

Look in js/components for the ES6 + Redux version. TODO: clean up + merge in react-transform-boilerplate code
